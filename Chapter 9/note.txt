Handle high correlated data that effect the standard linear model
 - Omit one of 2 correlated data
 - Use PCA or EFA with vif metric to combine correlated variables into one
  
Logistic Model
 - Binary outcome
 - glm() use formular similar to lm() for standard linear model
 
Hierarchical Model
 - Has multi level -> overall (all respondants) and individual (each respondant). One respondant can have multiple answers (rating with different value of a thing, opinion in different times, etc).
