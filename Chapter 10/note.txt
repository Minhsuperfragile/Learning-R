Chapter 10 introduced structural equation model
Which mean form an equation to construct latent variables from observed data. We can use EFA from chapter 8 to give a view to determine how many latent variables are there and also which observed variables they are manifested by.
We should use CB-SEM whenever we can. But there are some requirements that we need about our data to be able to fit it:
	- Enough data points (a few hundreds observation)
	- Normally distributed residual
	- Continous data
	- At least 3 indicators per factor
	- Reliablity of indicators

When our data doesn't match what is required for CB-SEM, we should use PLS-SEM. It can solve most of the problems.
